# auto-video-cutter
Edits videos based on timestamps you mark with hotkeys as you record the video. \
Core mechanic is Accept Segment / Reject Segment (see below) \
Does not trim silence as many other programs exist to do that, but can automatically run a silence trimming program after cuts are made.

Timestamps are created with keyboard shortcuts while you are recording, afterward the program will edit the video automatically based on the timestamps file
 

- Any time you [Accept Segment] that segment makes it into the final video, 
- Every time you [Reject Segment] that segment gets cut out and you are left to do a retake
- You can also [Reject Last Accepted] which will delete the last already accepted segment leaving you to retake it 
- You can also mark timestamps or segments for effects to be applied

Hit reject as many times as you want till you get a good take then hit accept (it will put in the segment from the last time you hit Reject till the time you hit Accept) 




Features described are not necessarily implemented yet this is a work in progress
