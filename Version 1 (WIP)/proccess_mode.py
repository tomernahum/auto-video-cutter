"""
Input:
- Main Video
- output video file name
- record mode data
    - each mod creates its own record mode data file
    - these are zipped into one file
"""

"""
Code:
- Unzip data files
- Call proccess mode functions in each mod passing in their corresponding data file
- Get lists of segments (clip & effects_list[specific function & info])
    - Segment: Clip & Effects_list
    - Effects List:
        - list of concrete functions (only input is vfc clips)
            - (may just be calling another function & passing in specific inputs)
        - each with data on breakability
            - function Input: VFC clips
            - function output: VFC clips
- Combine lists of segments into one list
    - some effects will get broken up into "parts"
- Apply the effect functions in the segments (to the input video)
    - 
- output the final video

"""
Code:
 - ...
 - get lists of segment_blueprints from each mod (pass in appropriate data)
 - combine all segment blueprints and convert to segments w clips on main video
 - apply all the effects
 - output
