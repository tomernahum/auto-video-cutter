timestamps

#we need to have multiple effects be proccessed that change the length of the video

[effect], incl cut, would have a method of it adjust the relative timestamp of every other timestamp 

def __ effect: (probably would be a subclasses)

    cut effect (we could convert the retake stuff into cut effects):
        timestamps before = no change
        timestamps after = - length of segment
        priority = 1 #lower number = higher priority
        timestamps in between  = continuas split   #^if there was a clip in between the cut that needed to be affected, it would be split around those clips so we can update the timestamps
        
        clip itself -> process -> return nothing

    speed up effect:
        timestamps before = no change
        timestamps after = -(original length of clip) + new(length of clip)
        timestamps in_between
        priority 2
        #so we would speed up the clip 

        clip itself -> proccess -> return sped up clip

    eg 0-10: speed.   5-7: cut
    we go through cronilogically
