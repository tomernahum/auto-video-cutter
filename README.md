# auto-video-cutter
Allows you to automatically cut out retakes in a video by pressing hotkeys while you are recording the video. Run record mode while recording to record a timestamps file, then run process mode with the timestamps file and video file to cut out parts you marked. May add effects in the future

## Demo video
Coming soon

## Record mode commands
Alt+Q to set a new "respawn checkpoint", Alt+W to go back to that checkpoint (cut out the video you recorded since that checkpoint). Alt+E to go back 2 checkpoints (such as if you set a checkpoint accidentally) \
AKA Alt+Q to "Accept" the previous segment, Alt+W to "Reject" the previous segment, Alt+E to "Reject the last accepted segment"
Alt+P to pause the recording (make sure this is synced with your recording software)

## Usage
1) follow the setup instructions below to setup the program
2) Open a separate recording program such as obs and make sure the hotkeys are set up properly
3) go to the main folder in this program in a command terminal and run python main.py,  OR on windows double click run.bat
4) Type in 1 for record mode
5) Follow instructions & see above section for how to use record mode
6) Once you're done recording, bring the video file generated by your recording program into the main folder of this program (I will make this a better system in the future potentially)
7) run main.py again and select 2 for process mode
8) enter the name of your video file and timestamps file as prompted
9) Wait for it to cut the video for you
10) Done!
11) You can run your video file through a silence trimmer program for further automated editing
12) Report any bugs in the issue page 

## Setup
1) Make sure you have the dependencies installed (see below)
2) Download this program as a folder
3) Set your preferred hotkeys by editing config.json
4) Set your recording program (such as OBS)'s hotkeys to be the same ones as this script's hotkeys for "start recording", "pause recording" and "end recording" so the timing is correct

## Dependencies
1) [Make sure you have python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) in terminal, type:
   1) pip3 install moviepy
   2) pip3 install keyboard

## Notes
this is a WIP but should be ready to use. The code in record mode in main was written a long time ago and doesn't seem very extendable so I might rewrite it. In the future it would be cool to integrate hand gesture tracking for commands as well as other things.
Also I will clean up the release with stuff such as a dependencies file & a license & whatever else at a later date

No promises about continued development though
