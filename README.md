# auto-video-cutter
Allows you to automatically cut out retakes in a video by pressing hotkeys while you are recording the video.

## Record mode commands
Alt+Q to set a new "respawn checkpoint", Alt+W to go back to that checkpoint (cut out the video you recorded since that checkpoint). Alt+E to go back 2 checkpoints (such as if you set a checkpoint accidentall)
AKA Alt+Q to "Accept" the previous segment, Alt+W to "Reject" the previous segment, Alt+E to "Reject the last accepted segment"

# Usage
1) Install this program as a folder
2) Set the "start recording", "pause recording" and "end recording" hotkeys in your recording software and this program to be the same
3) go to the main folder in this program in a command terminal and run python main.py, then input 1 for record mode
4) Select record mode, see above for how to use record mode
5) Once you're done, bring the video file into the main folder along (I will make this a better system in the future potentially)
6) run main.py again and select 2 for process mode
7) insert the name of your video file and the .txt file generated by the program
8) rename the file to whatever you want and you're done
9) You can run this through a silence trimmer programfor further automated editing
10) Report any bugs in the issue page 

currently you have to change the config in the code I will add a config file when I get around to it it shouldn't take very long to do


this is a WIP but should be ready to use. The code in record mode in main was written a long time ago and doesn't seem very extendable so I might rewrite it. In the future it would be cool to integrate hand gesture tracking for commands as well as other things.
Also I will clean up the release with stuff such as a dependencies file & a license & whatever else at a later date

No promises about continued development though

## Dependencies
pip install each of these. I will make a proper file at a later date.
1) moviepy
2) keyboard
